# Linear Congruential Generator

## Project Description

This project implements a Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) for generating pseudo-random numbers. The LCG is a type of finite pseudorandom number generator which is one of the oldest and best-known pseudorandom number generator algorithms. The purpose of this project is to illustrate how LCG works and to explore its period with different parameters.

## Features

- Generates a sequence of pseudo-random numbers using the linear congruential method.
- Determines the period of the sequence, i.e., how long it takes for the sequence to start repeating.
- Easy to modify parameters for experimentation with different types of generators.

## Installation

No installation is necessary beyond Python itself. To run the program, clone this repository and execute the Python script.
